# Glee

### We are Glee, our vision is for planetary scale resilience during natural disasters where everyone lives in a safe, resilient and sustainable world.

Essentially, Glee takes into consideration how buildings performed for previous earthquakes and enhances that with parameters based on nearby water bodies, age of the building, soil type, recent building modifications and more. This generates a heat map of buildings more likely to be damaged than others. The goal of the Glee algorithm is to predict how much damage a building will suffer, because thatâ€™s a useful indicator of where people will be injured and need help.
